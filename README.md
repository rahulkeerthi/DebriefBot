# DebriefBot
A Slack bot that simplifies end-of-day debriefs for teaching staff at Le Wagon, allowing them to focus on capturing meaningful content rather than needless admin. Built with JavaScript using the Bolt framework by Slack. Currently in production and live-tested with 3 London batches starting October 2020.
